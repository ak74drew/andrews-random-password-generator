# andrews-random-password-generator

In this project, which is my third project, I created a random password generator using CSS, HTML, and Javascript. 
This will allow the user to create a safe password, as well as the option to copy it to their clipboard. 
The password is between 8 - 128 characters long, and the password must have at least one of the following character types:
Lower case, Upper Case, Special, and Numeric characters.
